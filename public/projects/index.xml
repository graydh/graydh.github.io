      <description>By: Declan    In the spring of 2020, I completed a course called Data Visualization (590V) at UMass Amherst. Throughout the class in both its physical and online components, (thanks COVID) we explored both the psychology of visualizations and learned how to implement our own within the javascript D3 library. With a couple great students I met in the class, for our main project we created a set of visualizations to explore data from various Super Smash Melee tournaments hosted at UMass.</description>
