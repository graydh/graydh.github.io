      <description>By: Declan    The Minutemen Equity Fund is an undergraduate Isenberg School of Management student-run organization that manages over $250,000 of the UMass endowment. As a member of the fund, I worked as a Junior and then Senior Analyst covering the technology, financial and basic materials sectors. The analysts in each sector make recommendations regarding the fundâ€™s holdings and produce many deliverables along with three stock pitches a semester.</description>

      <title>GZoltar4Tests - Evaluating Spectrum-Based Fault Localization on Flaky Tests</title>

      <description>By: Declan    Working with Professors Marius Minea and Yuriy Brun for my undergraduate honors thesis, I modified an existing spectrum-based fault localization (SBFL) tool GZoltar to collect coverage on on test code across many re-execution in isolation. Our goal was to evaluate the effectivness on localizing the fault in the test code. By comparing the coverage between failing and passing test case executions, our tool attempts to locate the source of non-determinism in the test code.</description>

      <description>By: Declan    In the spring of 2020, I completed a course called Data Visualization (590V) at UMass Amherst. Throughout the class in both its physical and online components, (thanks COVID) we explored both the psychology of visualizations and learned how to implement our own within the javascript D3 library. With a couple great students I met in the class, for our main project we created a set of visualizations to explore data from various Super Smash Melee tournaments hosted at UMass.</description>

      <description>By: Milo and Declan    One of the most iconic classes within the Computer Science Major at the University of Massachusetts Amherst is Introduction to Computation (CS250). It is covers a vast quantity of computer science theory all the way from simple logic to Turing machines. I took the class with Professor Marius Minea in the Fall of 2019 and additionally completed a 1 credit honors colloquium extension to the course with Professor Minea in order to complete a computer science honors requirement.</description>
