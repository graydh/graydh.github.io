SOHCAHTOA is an acronym commonly taught to precalculus students to memorize the definition of trigonomic identiies, but it can be difficult for students to see how these formulas create waves or the asymtotes found in tangent. I set out to find a visualization builds on the gramatical approach to understanding the trigonomic functions.

Inspired by [this static plot](https://www.anirdesh.com/math/trig/trigonometric-measurements.php), I created a dynamic plot on Observable to explore the six main trig functions in one simple plot.
