One of the most iconic classes within the Computer Science Major at the University of Massachusetts Amherst is Introduction to Computation (CS250). It is covers a vast quantity of computer science theory all the way from simple logic to Turing machines. I took the class with Professor Marius Minea in the Fall of 2019 and additionally completed a 1 credit honors colloquium extension to the course with Professor Minea in order to complete a computer science honors requirement.

As a final project a peer Milo and I decide to try and apply SAT solving to the game of Clue. We imagined a web application that would allow users to play clue perfectly and help catch any lying opponents. 

We built a JavaScript application using node and a module logic-solver for our SAT checking.
